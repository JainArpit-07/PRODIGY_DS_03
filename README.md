# PRODIGY_DS_03
Third task of Prodigy InfoTech m1 Data Science intership.
A decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.
The decision tree is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of customers along with their purchase outcomes.

## Features

- Decision Tree Classifier: The core of the project is a decision tree algorithm that learns from the provided dataset to make predictions about customer purchases.

- Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the decision tree contains demographic information (e.g., age, gender) and behavioral data (e.g., browsing history, previous purchases).

- Evaluation: The project includes functions for evaluating the performance of the decision tree classifier, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
